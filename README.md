# Task-1
Implementing the entire GPT-2 model with all its details is beyond the scope of a single response due to its complexity. However, I can provide you with a simplified version of the GPT-2 model, focusing on the key components you mentioned: the multi-head self-attention mechanism, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding.

Please note that creating a full GPT-2 model requires significant time and resources. The code below is a simplified example for educational purposes and may not match the performance of the original GPT-2 model.
